# A Survey on Medical and Healthcare RAG: Recent Advances and New Frontiers

This repository provides a comprehensive survey on the application of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) in the medical and healthcare domains. We present the basic framework of medical RAG, detailing its commonly used components, datasets, and evaluation methods. Additionally, we've compiled a collection of state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches and highlighted some literature that explores new frontiers in this field. We are committed to regularly updating this repository and welcome any feedback or suggestions.
