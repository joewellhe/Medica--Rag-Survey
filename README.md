# A Survey on Medical and Healthcare RAG: Recent Advances and New Frontiers

This repository provides a comprehensive survey on the application of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) in the medical and healthcare domains. We present the basic framework of medical RAG, detailing its commonly used components, datasets, and evaluation methods. Additionally, we've compiled a collection of state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches and highlighted some literature that explores new frontiers in this field. We are committed to regularly updating this repository and welcome any feedback or suggestions.

### Introduction

With the emergence of large language models (LLMs) in recent years, numerous natural language processing (NLP) tasks have seen remarkable advancements. Their impressive capabilities in generating and understanding human-like text have resulted in outstanding performance in tasks such as summarization, question answering, information retrieval, and more. The exceptional performance of LLMs in core NLP tasks is prompting their exploration in the medical domain, ranging from aiding clinicians in making more accurate decisions to enhancing patient care quality and clinical outcomes. 

However, LLMs often generate plausible-sounding but factually incorrect responses, a phenomenon commonly known as hallucination. Additionally, once the training process is complete, the parameters of LLMs are fixed, resulting in a lack of up-to-date knowledge. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has the potential to alleviate these critical challenges because it can provide the rationale behind its generation and readily access the latest knowledge.

This survey focuses on useful techniques and the latest advances in medical and healthcare RAG. We first illustrate its basic framework and important components, and then we detail some useful improvements to these components separately. Next, we introduce datasets commonly used to evaluate medical and healthcare RAG, along with widely used knowledge sources. Finally, we present some evaluation metrics commonly used in experiments and explore new frontiers in this field.

(Please note that these new frontiers are constantly evolving. We strive to stay updated with the latest work and welcome any suggestions.)
